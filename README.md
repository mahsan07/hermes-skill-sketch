# Sketch

> Create throwaway HTML mockups with two or three design variants for comparison.

This repository packages a single, reusable Hermes skill as a documentation-first public reference. It explains the problem, operating contract, safety boundaries, expected evidence, and example usage without claiming a bundled runtime that is not present.

## Why this exists

Creative requests often lose their intent between the initial brief, generation, export, and final quality check. **Sketch** turns that work into an explicit sequence with visible inputs, outputs, review points, and completion evidence.

## Why the repository has this name

The shared `hermes-skill-` prefix identifies this as a portable Hermes workflow package. `sketch` names the capability directly—sketch—so the repository remains searchable and understandable outside the original AI-OS workspace. The public title is **Sketch**.

## At a glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is it? | Creative production workflow packaged as a reusable Hermes `SKILL.md`. |
| What does it do? | Create throwaway HTML mockups with two or three design variants for comparison. |
| Who is it for? | Builders, operators, and reviewers who want a repeatable, inspectable workflow. |
| What is delivered? | A skill contract, examples, safety guidance, release checks, and rendered SVG diagrams. |
| Runtime status | Documentation-first reference package; connect it to the tools available in your own environment. |

## Visual system map

The diagram below is specific to this capability. It shows the real components and artifacts involved rather than a generic agent loop.

## Operation sequence

![Sketch actor and data sequence](assets/operation-sequence.svg)

1. Define the single design decision to explore
2. Create common content and constraints
3. Build two or three HTML variants
4. Render at desktop and phone sizes
5. Compare hierarchy density and interaction
6. Keep the selected direction or discard all

See [How it works](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) for the component-by-component walkthrough and evidence model.

## Example visual output

![Illustrative output produced by Sketch](assets/example-output.svg)

This is an explanatory mockup of the output shape—not fabricated proof that a live run occurred. The labels show the information a real result should expose for review.

## Decision and stop conditions

## Inputs

- A clear brief, audience, format, and visual or narrative constraints
- Source assets or references the user is allowed to use
- Export requirements and acceptance criteria

## Outputs

- A reviewable visual, media, or design artifact
- The parameters or source needed to revise it
- Validation notes for format, readability, and fidelity

## Example request

> Using original or licensed sample material, create throwaway HTML mockups with two or three design variants for comparison. Return the result, the evidence used to verify it, and any limitations or actions that still require approval.

More scenarios and expected results are in [Examples](docs/EXAMPLES.md).

## Safety and trust model

This workflow may create or change artifacts, so consequential actions require a preview and explicit authorization. It must stop when ownership, authorization, target state, or publication safety is ambiguous. Never place credentials, private endpoints, personal data, or environment-specific secrets in the skill package or its evidence.

Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before connecting the workflow to real accounts, devices, repositories, or production data.

## What this repository does not claim

- It does not grant rights to third-party assets or replace a final human creative review.
- It is not a hosted service, executable application, or vendor endorsement.
- It does not include credentials, private infrastructure, or the original personal AI-OS configuration.
- A successful example does not prove production readiness for every environment.

## Use this package

1. Read `SKILL.md` and confirm its trigger matches your task.
2. Copy the package into the skill location supported by your agent environment, or use it as a reference when authoring an equivalent workflow.
3. Replace tool assumptions with the tools actually available to you; do not add secrets to the repository.
4. Run the smallest safe example from `docs/EXAMPLES.md`.
5. Record verification evidence and review any consequential action before widening scope.

## Contributing

Improvements are welcome when they preserve narrow scope, honest capability claims, safe defaults, and reproducible verification. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
